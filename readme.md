# Gess

###Motivation

My final project for CS162 was an implementation of the board game [Gess](https://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/gess.html) in Python, playable from the command line. After completion, I decided to make the game playable via a GUI interface which I've implemented using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/).

###What You'll Need

* Full GUI version: 
The game requires Python3.6+ and PyGame to run the GUI version. 

* Command line version:
Without PyGame, the game can still be played from the command line with any version of Python3.

**To install PyGame:**

```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

If you don't have admin rights, or would like to only install PyGame for your current user profile, try adding the *user* flag, like so:

```
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```

If you are still having trouble installing PyGame, please visit the PyGame Wiki's [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) page.

###Work Left To Do

This game is a work in progress. A list of intended features I intend to add can be found on [the project's Kanban board](https://github.com/users/mitchcampbell/projects/3).
